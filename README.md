# MUP TOOLBOX README-file

MUP is the MATLAB-Simulink toolbox for uncertain systems handling. It is recommended to use the software for educational purposes. MUP is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty. Required dependencies are YALMIP and recommended solver is MOSEK or SeDuMi. They are not included in the toolbox.

If you use the MUP toolbox, we would be happy to hear about it. Please let us know at juraj.oravec@stuba.sk.

RMPC_BLOCK serves to compute online robust MPC control input for a given system state.
